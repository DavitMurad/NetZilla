Welcome to a project that beautifully blends personal interest with technical growth, a passion project that I believe turned into a solid portfolio piece.


**NetZilla** is more than just a Netflix-style clone, it‚Äôs a vibrant, feature-rich SwiftUI app that showcases my journey through:

Clean **MVVM** architecture

Use of **local storage** for features like liking/favoriting movies

Advanced **SwiftUI animations**, layout techniques, and component composition

Deep use of property wrappers: @State, @Binding, @EnvironmentObject, @AppStorage

API-driven content via **async/await** and proper **concurrency** handling

User interaction feedback using **sound effects**

Filtering by genre and media type using enums, custom logic, and dynamic view updates

Modular and scalable UI using components like CarouselView, FilterBarView, and FeaturedMovieView

üé• Favorite genre? MonsterVerse all the way. Had to sneak Godzilla and Kong in there.


# Technologies Used:

**SwiftUI** for all views and transitions

**Async/Await** for networking (replacing legacy Combine or closures)

Core Swift features like **Codable**, enums, and generics

@**MainActor** & @**Published** for safe state updates across the UI

**Custom ViewModifiers** and reusable components to keep code clean

**UserDefaults** for persistent likes


# Highlights:

Dynamic movie filtering by **TV Shows**, **Movies**, and **Genre**

Scrollable horizontal **carousels** with section headers

Full-screen movie detail view with overlay buttons

Fun touches like **sound playback** on play interaction

Cyberpunk-inspired color gradients and neon-themed UI


# Challenges and Learnings:

While I handled most of the app logic independently, I relied on external help for the genre filtering logic, especially coordinating selected values between the filter bar and the modal. I am planning to revisit this area with better architectural clarity in the future as it is a common feature across mobile apps, always room to grow!

# Reflection:

This project taught me a ton ‚Äî not just about SwiftUI, but also about good UX design, state management, and balancing complexity with simplicity.
It‚Äôs a strong first step toward an iOS development roles, and many of the concepts covered are core expectations for starter to mid-level iOS positions ‚Äî such as local storage, architectural patterns, reactive UI, async networking, and modular SwiftUI design.

I'm excited to dive even deeper into other iOS development essentials in my upcoming projects to have a solid foundation as a tech specialist

This is only the beginning.

Cheers ‚úåÔ∏è
